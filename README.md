# Liip Monitor Bundle #

This bundle provides a way to run a series of application related health checks. Health checks in the scope of this bundle go beyond simple actions like performing a _ping_ to a server to see if it's alive. For example a Memcache server can be alive and not displaying any errors in your Nagios but you might not be able to access it from your PHP application. Each health check should then implement some application logic that you want to make sure always works. Another usage can be testing for specific requirements, like availability of PHP extensions.

Another design goal of the bundle was to be able to perform the checks using the same configuration and environment that your application is using. In that way you can make sure that if the health check runs successfully then your app should work too.

So each health check will be a class that will implement the `CheckInterface::check` method which must return a `CheckResult` object. What happens inside that method
is up to the Check developer.

Health checks are defined as Symfony services and they have to be tagged as `monitor.check` in order to be picked up by the _Health Check Runner_. This gives a lot of flexibility to application and bundle developers when they want to add their own checks.

Checks are run via the command line using a Symfony command or via a REST api that delivers the results in JSON format.

Here's the web interface:

## Installation ##

Add the following code to your deps file:

    [LiipMonitorBundle]
        git=git://github.com/liip/LiipMonitorBundle.git
        target=bundles/Liip/MonitorBundle

And then run the vendors install command:

    $ ./bin/vendors install

Ensure the Liip namespace can be loaded by updating your autoload.php:

    $loader->registerNamespaces(array(
        ...
        'Liip'             => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
        ...
    ));

Then register the bundle in the `AppKernel.php` file:

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            ...
            new Liip\MonitorBundle\LiipMonitorBundle(),
            ...
        );

        return $bundles;
    }

If you want to enable the REST API provided by the bundle then add the following to your `routing.yml`:

    _monitor:
        resource: "@LiipMonitorBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"

And finally don't forget to install the bundle assets into your web root:

    $ ./app/console assets:install web --symlink

## Writing Health Checks ##

Let's see an example on how to implement a Health Check class. In this case we are going to test for the availability of PHP Extensions:

    namespace Acme\HelloBundle\Check;

    use Liip\MonitorBundle\Check\Check;
    use Liip\MonitorBundle\Exception\CheckFailedException;
    use Liip\MonitorBundle\Result\CheckResult;

    class PhpExtensionsCheck extends Check
    {
        protected $extensions;

        public function __construct($extensions)
        {
            $this->extensions = $extensions;
        }

        public function check()
        {
            try {
                foreach ($this->extensions as $extension) {
                    if (!extension_loaded($extension)) {
                        throw new CheckFailedException(sprintf('Extension %s not loaded', $extension));
                    }
                }
                return $this->buildResult('OK', CheckResult::SUCCESS);
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
                return $this->buildResult(sprintf('KO - %s', $e->getMessage()), CheckResult::FAILURE);
            }
        }

        public function getName()
        {
            return "PHP Extensions Health Check";
        }
    }

As you can see our constructor will take an array with the names of the extensions our application requires. Then on the `check` method it will iterate over that array to test for each of the extensions. If there are no problems then the check will return a `CheckResult` object with a message (`OK` in our case) and the result status (`CheckResult::SUCCESS` in our case). As you can see this is as easy as it gets.

Once you implemented the class then it's time to register the check service with our service container:

    services:
        monitor.check.php_extensions:
            class: Acme\HelloBundle\Check\PhpExtensionsCheck
            arguments:
                - [ xhprof, apc, memcache ]
            tags:
                - { name: monitor.check }

The important bit there is to remember to tag your services with the `monitor.check` tag. By doing that the Check Runner will be able to find your checks. Keep in mind that Checks can reside either in your bundles or in your app specific code. The location doesn't matter as long as the service is properly tagged.

## Running Checks ##

There are two ways of running the health checks: by using the CLI or by using the REST API provided by the bundle. Let's see what commands we have available for the CLI:

### List Checks ###

    $ ./app/console monitor:list

    monitor.check.jackrabbit
    monitor.check.redis
    monitor.check.memcache
    monitor.check.php_extensions

### Run All the Checks ###

    ./app/console monitor:health

    Jackrabbit Health Check: OK
    Redis Health Check: OK
    Memcache Health Check: KO - No configuration set for session.save_path
    PHP Extensions Health Check: OK

### Run Individual the Checks ###

To run an individual check you need to provide the check id to the `health` command:

    $ ./app/console monitor:health monitor.check.php_extensions

    PHP Extensions Health Check: OK

## REST API DOCS ##
